BUILD A PUBLIC, FORKABLE GITHUB REPOSITORY:

agent-guardrails-patterns

This is NOT an application. It is a reference repository.
It should be clean, intentional, and operator-grade.

GOAL
Create a practical, opinionated library of guardrail patterns for agentic AI systems.
The audience is technical leaders, security teams, and AI operators.

This repo must:
- be forkable
- avoid hype
- avoid claiming compliance
- emphasize judgment and control
- feel written by someone who has deployed real systems

--------------------------------------------------
STYLE + TONE (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

Writing tone:
- direct
- precise
- no buzzwords
- no motivational language
- short paragraphs
- bullet-heavy
- declarative statements

Assume the reader is competent.

# Agent Guardrails Patterns

Practical guardrail patterns for agentic AI systems.

This repository documents control patterns used to constrain autonomous or semi-autonomous agents in production environments.

It is not a framework.
It is not a product.
It is not a compliance checklist.

It is a reference.

## What this is

This repository contains:
- guardrail patterns for agentic systems
- design principles for limiting blast radius
- example schemas for policy and risk classification
- lightweight TypeScript examples

The goal is to help teams design systems that act with intent, visibility, and restraint.

## What this is not

This is not:
- legal advice
- security certification
- a promise of safety
- an excuse to avoid judgment

Guardrails reduce risk. They do not remove it.

## Why this exists

Agentic systems fail in predictable ways:
- they overreach
- they act without context
- they bypass controls
- they fail confidently

Most failures are not model failures.
They are system design failures.

This repository focuses on the system.

## How to use this

Fork the repository.
Adapt the patterns.
Integrate them into your own architecture.

Do not copy blindly.

patterns/README.md
--------------------------------------------------

Write a short index explaining that each file documents a single control pattern.
List and link:
- Approval gates
- Tool allowlists
- Blast radius containment
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Logging and audit

--------------------------------------------------
PATTERN FILES (CONTENT GUIDELINES)
--------------------------------------------------

For each pattern file in /patterns, follow this structure:

Title
Short description (1–2 sentences)

Sections:
- Problem
- Pattern
- When to use
- When not to use
- Failure modes
- Notes

Keep each file concise (400–700 words max).

--------------------------------------------------
schemas/
--------------------------------------------------

Create JSON Schemas that define:
1) agent-risk.schema.json
   - agent type
   - data access level
   - action scope
   - autonomy level
   - required controls

2) tool-policy.schema.json
   - tool name
   - allowed actions
   - approval requirements
   - logging requirements

Schemas should be realistic but generic.

--------------------------------------------------
examples/
--------------------------------------------------

Create lightweight TypeScript examples that demonstrate:
- enforcing approval before tool execution
- wrapping tool calls with logging
- blocking actions outside allowlist

Examples should be readable, not production-ready.
No dependencies beyond basic TypeScript.

--------------------------------------------------
notes/
--------------------------------------------------

design-principles.md:
- separation of intent and execution
- explicit boundaries
- default deny
- observability before autonomy

common-failure-modes.md:
- over-broad permissions
- silent tool escalation
- missing audit trails
- human override ambiguity

--------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT RULES
--------------------------------------------------

- Do not mention specific vendors.
- Do not mention compliance standards (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR).
- Do not claim safety or correctness.
- Do not use marketing language.
- Do not include diagrams.
- No TODOs.
- Everything should feel intentional and finished.

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------

The repository should read like internal documentation that escaped into public view.
It should feel calm, controlled, and opinionated.

Implement everything now.
