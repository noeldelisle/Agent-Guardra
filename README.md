# Agent Guardrails Patterns

Practical guardrail patterns for agentic AI systems.

This repository documents control patterns used to constrain autonomous or semi-autonomous agents in production environments.

It is not a framework.
It is not a product.
It is not a compliance checklist.

It is a reference.

## What this is

This repository contains:
- guardrail patterns for agentic systems
- design principles for limiting blast radius
- example schemas for policy and risk classification
- lightweight TypeScript examples

The goal is to help teams design systems that act with intent, visibility, and restraint.

## What this is not

This is not:
- legal advice
- security certification
- a promise of safety
- an excuse to avoid judgment

Guardrails reduce risk. They do not remove it.

## Why this exists

Agentic systems fail in predictable ways:
- they overreach
- they act without context
- they bypass controls
- they fail confidently

Most failures are not model failures.
They are system design failures.

This repository focuses on the system.
